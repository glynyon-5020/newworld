You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creatureâ€™s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you canâ€™t use them.\nWhen you transform, you assume the dragonâ€™s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in dragon form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesnâ€™t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you arenâ€™t knocked unconscious.\nYou can cast your dragoon spells while using dragon Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a dragoon spell while in a beast shape, and the draconic runes are inscribed in your scales.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you canâ€™t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your dragon form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creatureâ€™s shape and size. Your equipment doesnâ€™t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form canâ€™t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again."
