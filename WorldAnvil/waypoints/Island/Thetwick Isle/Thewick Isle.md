# Thetwick Isle

Among the Dragonsmoke Archipelago, Thetwick Isle is among the most enigmatic. Traditional methods of navigation tend to become untrustworthy as the currents reverse without explanation and the very stars above the island move and dance on a whim. Those vessels which do reach the island find a subtropical paradise of soaring cliffs of vibrant red stone covered in emerald green vines and trees. The brilliant blue waters look clear enough to drink, and some who have returned have said they have seen sirens and merfolk swimming alongside their vessels.
