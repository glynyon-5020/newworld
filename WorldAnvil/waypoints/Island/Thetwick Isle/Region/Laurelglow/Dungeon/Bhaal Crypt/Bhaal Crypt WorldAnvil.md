[h1]Waytravel to the Crypt of Bhaal's Minions in Thas'ru[/h1]

[dc]W[/dc]

ith the passing of Eleyta the Oracle, the ancient seals on this forsaken crypt have been broken, laying bare a tomb for the corrupted servants of the Lord of Murder. Something must be done, and soon, for the plans of Bhaal have been known to have many layers as the dead god schemes to return in force to the world of the living.

[h1|dungeon-notes]Dungeon Notes[/h1]

[b]NOTE:[/b] This dungeon is NOT meant to be completed in one sitting. It is composed of around 15 encounters. Please visit @[Solo Dungeons](article:a23712d9-cf22-4525-a54c-6d0298126828) to learn how to stop your session at a particular point, effectively creating a "Save Game/Checkpoint" that you can return to in a later session.


[h2|dungeon-encounter-summary]Dungeon Encounter Summary[/h2]
This dungeon is composed of 3 Easy Encounters, 2 Medium Encounters, 3 Hard Encounters, 5 Deadly Encounters and 1 Boss Encounter.

Bhaal's Crypt is a hard dungeon. The average encounter difficulty (of 14 encounters) is [b]hard[/b].

[h1|prerequisites]Dungeon Pre-requisites[/h1]
You must complete the following steps before gaining access to this dungeon; these must be completed by each character participating:

[ul]
    [li]Bhaal's Crypt can only be found when you've discovered a Monster Lair using the random world generation process found in The Solo Toolbox; you will likely face other encounters if you follow this process.
    [br][/li]
    [li]Complete a Slow Moderate Skill Challenge to discover the entrance to Bhaal's Crypt at the abandoned Monster Lair.[/li]
[/ul]

Bhaal's Crypt is located deep within the fey touched wilderness in the environment outside of the centaur Metropolis of Thas'ru. Locating it is no simple task, even for those who know what they are looking for.

[h1|rewards]Dungeon Rewards[/h1]

This dungeon is under no one's jurisdiction. You receive four minor potions or scrolls for completing it.

At the completion of the dungeon (all encounters complete), a DM will roll three Treasure Hoards for you and your name will be added to the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/dungeon3A-bhaal-s-crypt-landmark#completion]Completionist List[/url]. This will count as three of your eighteen Tier II treasure hoards. You will not be able to benefit from this dungeon on this character again (you may attempt to tackle the special encounters, however).

There are hidden chests in this dungeon. You must beat the listed DC with either a perception or investigation check. Failure the first time means you do not find it. If you wish to continue to seek for it, you must complete any combination of four hard skill challenges or combat encounters to try again.

[h1|icons-and-map]Dungeon Icons & Map Link[/h1]

Throughout the dungeon, you will stumble across icons. These icons will correlate with the room description. With the exception of the Ravine and the Vault the ceilings throughout the dungeon are approximately 10 feet high. A huge creature is considered to be squeezing when it moves through the dungeon aside from in those rooms. The ravine drops 30 feet below floor level, and the ceiling in that room is 20 feet high. In the vault, the ceiling is 20 feet high, and the pit is 60 feet deep.

You must first add a token to initiative before you can assign the map to it. !i add 0 dm -p 100

[code]!map -bg https://i.imgur.com/6Kf5bzF.jpg -mapsize 68x88 -options c35d -view w78:ar88 -fow w78:ar88[/code]

You can see the entire map view by running !view reset and focus in on an area by running [b]!view x#:y#[/b]. 

You can expand your fog of war by running [b]!map -fow x#:y#[/b]. For both of these, x is the top left corner of the area you want to view/reveal and y is the bottom right corner.

Your characters begin in Room 16 - the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/dungeon3A-bhaal-s-crypt-landmark#room16]Entryway[/url].

[h1|long-resting]Long Resting[/h1]

In order to long rest, characters must reach the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/dungeon3A-bhaal-s-crypt-landmark#room16]Entryway[/url] and defeat any Encounters which spawn there. Once you have exited Bhaal's Crypt, you must follow the requirements listed on the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/laurelglow-location#weather]Laurelglow Region's page[/url]. While a character may complete a short rest within the dungeon, multiple consecutive short rests and long rests are impossible until you have exited the dungeon.

[h1|wandering-monsters]Wandering Monsters[/h1]
When you enter a room, these monsters may also be there. If the room is empty, there's a 50% chance the wandering monsters are present. If the room already contains a monster, there's a 10% chance the monsters are present.

As this dungeon is built for anyone between level 5 and level 10, you must use the [b]!1Encounter [/b]command to determine what you face. You will choose monsters based off the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/dungeon3A-bhaal-s-crypt-landmark#mobs]solo encounter list[/url].

These encounters show up in the following order; once they are defeated, they cannot bother you again.

Aside from the entrance to the south, a stairwell leads out of the chamber to the west.

[b]Monster:[/b] Boss Encounter

[b]Boss Encounter:[/b] The Heirophant of Bhaal. Heirophant is "one" creature that you fight in one deadly encounter. Heirophant is a conglomerate of all the creatures that compose a deadly encounter for your character (if !rEncounter deadly yields more than one monster). So if a deadly encounter for me was 2x CR1, Heirophant would be composed of two dread warriors (with their damage type changed to necrotic and an additional 1d4 necrotic damage, DC 10 Constitution saving throw to take half damage). As you kill these "parts" of Heirophant, the contribution of that monster will no longer apply to the encounter, thus weakening Heirophant as his parts "die."

[h4|hidden-chest]Hidden Chest[/h4]
There is a chest hidden in this room. A character must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15) to locate its hiding place. Once located, the chest can only be removed with a successful Strength (Athletics) check (DC 16). Once removed, the chest can be unlocked with a Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check (DC 15) or pried open with a Strength (Athletics) check (DC 30). Truly desperate treasure seekers can attempt to break the chest with weapons, but it has an AC of 20, 60 hit points, and a damage threshold of 10 (ignoring any amount of damage from a single attack under 10 damage).

[b]Features:[/b]This long, wide corridor seems to form a nexus within the complex. A stairwell at the southern end leads up, before splitting off to the east and the west. A narrow stairway leads off from midway along the western wall. At the northern end of the passage, a narrow stairway curves down from the west, before ending at the foot of a wider stairway leading to the east. Nothing else of note stands out among the crudely carved stone.

[br][h4]Hidden Chest[/h4]
There is a chest hidden in this room. A character must succeed on an Intelligence (Religion) or Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 15) to reveal its hiding place. Once located, the chest can only be forced to appear with a successful Charisma saving throw (DC 16). Once it appears, the chest can be unlocked with an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 15) or pried open with a Strength (Athletics) check (DC 30). Truly desperate treasure seekers can attempt to break the chest with weapons, but it has an AC of 20, 60 hit points, and a damage threshold of 10 (ignoring any amount of damage from a single attack under 10 damage).

        The Iconoclast has inscribed a [url:https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/symbol]Symbol[/url] of Fear inscribed on the northeast corner of the room.

    [li]
        These Symbols can be activated with a command word, which the Enchanter can use as a reaction if they are able to position themselves outside of the area of effect while an enemy is within it. The Iconoclast is willing to sacrifice their Shield Guardian to this spell. The Enchanter may attempt to use the Disengage action on their turn before leaving the area of effect.
    [/li]
[/ul]


If the Iconoclast is defeated while the Shield Guardian still lives, the character may attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 16) followed by a Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 17) to recognize the Master's Amulet around the Iconoclast's neck. The character must make the Perception check as an action on their turn. Both removing the Master's Amulet from the Iconoclast and placing it around another's neck require an Object Interaction, but a character may use an action to complete the second Object Interaction, if they choose. Once a character has the Master's Amulet around their neck, the Shield Guardian recognizes them as their master, but the character must attune to the Master's Amulet before they can issue it any commands.

If a party secures the amulet in this way, they receive experience equivalent to defeating the Shield Guardian (2,900xp).

[h4]Encounter Notes[/h4]

Heirophant Reborn inhabits a special lair. These are the defining qualities:


Heirophant Reborn appears with two [url:https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/acolyte]Acolytes[/url], which each have the ability [b]Unholy Fortitude[/b].


[b]Unholy Fortitude.[/b] If damage reduces the acolyte to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the acolyte drops to 1 hit point instead.


Heirophant Reborn can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Heirophant Reborn regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

[ul]

[h4]Prerequisites[/h4]

[ul]
    [li]
        Clear the Bhaal's Crypt Dungeon and return to the Ancient Archive (Room 3).
    [/li]
    [li]
        Complete a roleplay session involving at least five lines of dialogue describing your character putting the archived works to the torch.
    [/li]
    [li]
        Complete a slow moderate skill challenge, involving at least two successful Constitution saving throws and one successful Charisma saving throw to withstand the smoke and will the fire to consume the archived works. A character which does not need to breathe succeeds on the Constitution saving throws automatically.
    [/li]
[/ul]

[h4]Encounter Notes[/h4]

Defender of the Word inhabits a special lair. These are the defining qualities. While within the archive, when the Defender of the Word is present, the fire continues to rage. At the start of each character's turn, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12), or become incapacitated by billowing smoke until the beginning of their next turn. A creature which does not need to breathe succeeds on this saving throw automatically.


The flames can be avoided, but the intense heat makes it difficult to function except through an act of extreme will. At the start of each character's turn, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12), or become frightened by the fire until the beginning of their next turn. A creature with resistance to fire damage or immunity from fire damage succeeds on this saving throw automatically.


A character may retreat from the room in order to avoid these effects, but if the Defender of the Word is the only creature remaining in the Ancient Archive at the beginning of its turn, it can extinguish the flames as an action, and it disappears. If this occurs, a character must complete the slow moderate skill challenge listed in the prerequisites once more, and the Defender of the Word returns with full hit points and spell slots restored.

[h4]Encounter Notes[/h4]

Ardor inhabits a special lair. These are the defining qualities. On initiative count 0, one character currently in combat with Ardor must sacrifice 1 Divine Favor. If a character cannot or does not, Ardor disappears and all remaining creatures are expelled from Bhaal's Crypt.


Ardor has the ability to fly as a move action for 40 feet. If Ardor is not on solid ground at the end of its turn, it descends slowly at a rate of 60 feet per round until it lands on solid ground.

    [/li]
[/ul]

[h4]Encounter Notes[/h4]

Bhaal's Malus Mortem inhabits a special lair. These are the defining qualities. So long as Bhaal's Malus Mortem is present, the light throughout Bhaal's Crypt becomes dim light. Spells and effects such as [url:https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/darkness]Darkness[/url] and [url:https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/daylight]Daylight[/url] which are in effect that would change the light quality are immediately dispelled (or suppressed if they cannot be dispelled) and non-magical fires are extinguished. If there are multiple characters present, Bhaal's Malus Mortem attempts to isolate one character using Shadow Jump, prioritizing spellcasters over ranged attackers over melee attackers.


After Bhaal's Malus Mortem has been defeated, it regenerates after a week, but avoids heroes who have defeated it in the past.
