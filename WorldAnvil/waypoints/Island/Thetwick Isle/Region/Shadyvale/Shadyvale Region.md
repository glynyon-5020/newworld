While exploring the Archipelago on his trusted companion, Wyrmling Drallengrey discovered a lush forested landscape. The canopy blocked almost all light from reaching the ground below and a large number of magnificent flora & fungi dotted the landscape. As he explored the area, shapes of nearby fungi started to move and Drallengrey took the opportunity to report back his findings.
