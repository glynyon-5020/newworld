[h1]Waytravel to The Savage Haunt...[/h1]

[dc]N[/dc]

ot far from the grand city of Wildcross, in some nondescript area of the surrounding jungle, exists the Savage Haunt. The soft drizzling rain dampens you and your gear as you stand in a jungle clearing, the waist-high grass obscuring the glowing light blue runes arrayed in a circle on the ground composing the waygate. In front of you is a crevise in a tall rock face emanating a pale yellow light. This is The Savage Haunt; rumor states a large band of wererats has made this their home... 

[b]]Tier II Waypoint[/b] | The Iron Coin will not allow anyone through of 4th level or lower. The monsters present flee instinctively should anyone of 11th level or higher arrive. 

[h1|conditions]Natural Stone and Conditions[/h1]
The floors and walls of these cavern complex is made of natural stone. You can climb the 15-foot walls using a DC 10 athletics check. [b]The floor is difficult terrain[/b]; acrobatics checks are made at disadvantage. The air is almost uncomfortably warm. The cavern is illuminated by yellow phosphorescent fungus every 20 feet, causing the vast majority of the underground system to be dimly lit. 

[h1|wererats]Wererats[/h1]
For lore-specific purposes, you are not fighting werewolves, wereboars, or werebears. You are, instead, fighting more powerful versions of the wererat. If you contract lycanthropy from any of these monsters, you are contracting the wererat version of the curse. There wererats have trained kruthiks as pets, and their nemesis of the caves are the troglodytes.

This dungeon waypoint functions like other waypoints. You can show up, kill monsters, harvest the region-specific natural resource, fulfill the prerequisites, and defeat the specialty encounters.

Dungeon waypoints do have an additional feature. You may travel through a pre-built dungeon which provides you the opportunity to earn magical items in your solo adventures.

[h1|dungeon-notes]Dungeon Notes[/h1]

[aloud]NOTE: This dungeon is NOT meant to be completed in one sitting. It is composed of around 15 encounters. Please visit @[Solo Dungeons](article:a23712d9-cf22-4525-a54c-6d0298126828) to learn how to stop your session at a particular point, effectively creating a "Save Game/Checkpoint" that you can return to in a later session.[/aloud]


[h2|dungeon-encounter-summary]Dungeon Encounter Summary[/h2]
This dungeon is composed of 3 Easy Encounters, 2 Medium Encounters, 3 Hard Encounters, 5 Deadly Encounters and 1 Boss Encounter.

The Savage Haunt is a hard dungeon. The average encounter difficulty (of 14 encounters) is [b]hard[/b].

[h1|prerequisites]Dungeon Pre-requisites[/h1]
You must complete the following steps before gaining access to this dungeon; these must be completed by each character participating:
[ul]
  [li]
     Expend 1 piece of lore in [url:https://discord.com/channels/733841578174447717/803740991903367168/811987299365027882]The Mage's College[/url] discord channel
   [/li]
[/ul]

The Savage Haunt is full of creatures with SIGNIFICANT defenses. For your character to learn about these defenses (and prevent you as a player from walking blindly into a deathtrap), you must first learn of the threats you face and how you might overcome them. It is located in the northernmost regions of Greater Wildcross.

[h1|rewards]Dungeon Rewards[/h1]

This dungeon is under Mage's College jurisdiction. You receive 200 reputation for clearing it or four minor potions.

At the completion of the dungeon (all encounters complete), a DM will roll three Treasure Hoards for you and your name will be added to the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/the-savage-haunt-location#completion]Completionist List[/url]. This will count as three of your eighteen Tier II treasure hoards. You will not be able to benefit from this dungeon on this character again (you may continue to gather Nightshade or tackle the special encounters, however).

There are hidden chests in this dungeon. You must beat the listed DC with either a perception or investigation check. Failure the first time means you do not find it. If you wish to continue to seek for it, you must complete any combination of four hard skill challenges or combat encounters to try again.

[h1|map-start]Dungeon Icons & Map Link[/h1]

Throughout the dungeon, you will stumble across icons. These icons will correlate with the room description.

You must first add a token to initiative before you can assign the map to it. !i add 0 dm -p 100

You can see the entire map view by running !view reset and focus in on an area by running [b]!view x#:y#[/b]. 

You can expand your fog of war by running [b]!map -fow x#:y#[/b]. For both of these, x is the top left corner of the area you want to view/reveal and y is the bottom right corner.

You can climb the 15-foot walls using a DC 10 athletics check. The floor is difficult terrain; acrobatics checks are made at disadvantage. The air is almost uncomfortably warm. 

    Long resting within the caverns requires a DC 11 Survival check. The modifier used to determine interruption **begins** at **somewhat likely** (*!heydm am i interruped? somewhat likely*) when long resting. If you're interrupted, you must check if it's an encounter (*!heydm is it an encounter?*); if it's not, it's a harmless interruption and you may complete your long rest.

[h1|long-resting]Long Resting[/h1]
Long resting within the caverns requires a DC 11 Survival check. The modifier used to determine interruption [b]begins[/b] at [b]somewhat likely[/b] ([i]!heydm am i interruped? somewhat likely[/i]) when long resting. If you're interrupted, you must check if it's an encounter ([i]!heydm is it an encounter?[/i] ); if it's not, it's a harmless interruption and you may complete your long rest.

You may take a long rest outside of the cave system (DC 6 Survival Check, normal check for long rests found in @[3.3 Resting in a Solo Session](article:e814002e-52e7-4616-b7c9-4c7044e3ab33)), but then you have a 75% chance of needing to repeat your last successful encounter as the enemies try to reclaim their territory.

[h1|wandering-monsters]Wandering Monsters[/h1]
When you enter a room, these monsters may also be there. If the room is empty, there's a 50% chance the wandering monsters are present. If the room already contains a monster, there's a 10% chance the monsters are present. You have disadvantage on perception checks that rely on sight. They have advantage on perception checks that rely on smell. Run [b]!heydm are they being noisy?[/b] to cancel out your disadvantage.

As this dungeon is built for anyone between level 5 and level 10, you must use the [b]!1Encounter [/b]command to determine what you face. You will choose monsters based off the [url:https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/the-savage-haunt-location#solo]solo encounter list[/url].

These encounters show up in the following order; once they are defeated, they cannot bother you again.

[b]Boss Encounter:[/b] Corthol the Wererat Leader. Corthol is "one" creature that you fight in three consecutive easy encounters. Corthol is a conglomerate of all the creatures that compose an easy encounter for your character. So if an easy encounter for me was 1 CR 1 and 2 CR 1/4, Corthol would be composed of two troglodytes and one quasit. As you kill these "parts" of Corthol, that monster contribution will no longer apply to the encounter, thus weakening Corthol as his parts "die." After the first easy encounter ends, you must immediately engage in the second easy encounter or succeed in a fast moderate skill challenge to obtain a rest. The same format follows between second and third encounters.
