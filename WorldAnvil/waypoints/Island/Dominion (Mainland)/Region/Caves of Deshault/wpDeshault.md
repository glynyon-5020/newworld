-desc "*As the crackling of the waygate settles, the sound of dripping water and the howling of an eerie draft greets you. A few moments pass and the waygate's energy disperses, plunging the cavern into darkness. Though mostly quiet, the occasional scratching, scurrying, scuttling, or screeching signify that you're not alone in [The Caves of Deshault](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/the-caves-of-deshault-location).*

**Tier III Waypoint** | The Iron Coin will not allow anyone through of 10th level or lower. The monsters present flee instinctively should anyone of 16th level or higher arrive.

This location suffers from **extreme cold** (see WA). The dwarven city of **Therfarum** (see WA) also resides within this cave system, about one day's travel from the waygate.
