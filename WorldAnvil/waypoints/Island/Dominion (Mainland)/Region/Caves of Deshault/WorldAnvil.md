[h1]Waytravel to the Caves of Deshault[/h1]

[dc]A[/dc]

s the crackling of the waygate settles, the sound of dripping water and the howling of a bonechilling, eerie draft greets you. A few moments pass and the waygate's energy disperses, plunging the cavern into darkness. Though mostly quiet, the occasional scratching, scurrying, scuttling, or screeching signify that you're not alone in the freezing Caves of Deshault.

The dwarven city of @[Therfarum](settlement:8b2a69ca-4a3a-4201-82e3-c3ebf34a36bb) also resides within this cave system, about one day's travel from the waygate.

This location suffers from [url:https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#WildernessSurvival]extreme cold[/url]. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of [url:https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion]exhaustion[/url]. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

    [b]WANTED: Plaguebreather[/b]

    A hideos creature of death and decay was loosed by one of Therfarum's enemies some centuries ago. The creature was thought to have been thwarted but appears to have only delved deep into the caves. An unfortunate miner returned to his encampment detailing what he saw before the boils consumed his body. The contagion spread and claimed the lives of those miners. We had to put the pieces together from the discovered ruins of their camp...|Joni Frostmason

[ul]
    [li]Expend 5 Lore, Divine Favor, Middle- or Upper-class Contacts.[/li]
    [li]Travel 5 days in the subterranean caverns. 6d100 per day, 76+ resuls in a wilderness encounter.[/li]
    [li]Complete 3 Medium encounters. Add a cave fisher onto that encounter (if a medium encounter is a CR 3 and 2 CR 1/2, you ADD a Cave Fisher onto that).[/li]
    [li]You run into the cave fisher lair the Plaguebreather uses as a cover for its own lair; you must defeat twenty cave fishers in one encounter.[/li]
    [li]While you are looking for The Plaguebreather, you must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity Saving Throw, Initiative Check, or Perception Check to spot it. Failure means it gets a free claw attack against you; it remains untargetable until you pass this check.[/li]
    [li]If more than one individual shows up to hunt the Plaguebreather, the gases in its lair increase, causing hallucinations, and there are now [i]two[/i] Oinoloth's that join initiative.[/li]
[/ul]

[code]
    !i madd oinoloth -name "The Plaguebringer" -hp 180 adv
    !i add 0 "Lair Action" -p 100
[/code]

The Plaguebreather has advantage on initative checks and starts off with 180 hit points. If more than one individual shows up to hunt the her, both hallucinations have 180 hit points and roll advantage for initiative.

The Plaguebringer has already blighted the entrace to her lair. The moment you begin the encounter, you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the oinoloth’s Bringer of Plagues for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and is poisoned. She begins the encounter with [b]Bringer of Plagues[/b] recharged.

Her lair is a large cavern, 120-foot radius, with stalactites and stalagmites--plenty of obstacles for her to hid behind. If she is dealt more than 25 damage in one turn, she will use an action to teleport to a random location near a stalagmite and then utilize a bonus action to hide. While outside of your range, she will cast her spells.

On her lair action, she can utilize her teleport action.

If she falls below 50 hit points, she will use Corrupted Healing on herself.

    [li]Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Any creature, including one on the Ethereal Plane, that is hostile to the tyrant and starts its turn within 10 feet of a wall must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.[/li]

    [b]Contract: Aro, Dwarfbane[/b]

    The dragoness Aro has been a constant thorn in our side. Much of our wealth and strength as a nation comes from the channeling crystals we mine from these caverns. Aro has decided to build herself up a hoard of these wondrous stones, piling them up as if hoards of treasure. She's reached the point of aggression and theft; such an act cannot go unpunished.

    If she's willing to parlay, so be it. She does help to keep The Tunneler at bay. If you do slay her, you'll also be rewarded. Though know the caverns will be significantly less safe... | King Bifund Frosthand

    A beast of incredible size and power haunts the far reaches of our caverns. The cave system goes uncharted to the east, past Antilda's Watch, and the west past Hogan's Stand. We cannot tell if there is one or many; we only know that all who venture past these far outposts never return. It seems to listen to the vibrations in the earth and know when its prey is near.

    After hundreds of years of recording, we've noticed that it seems to steer clear of Aro's lair. | King Bifund Frosthand
