Drallengrey is going to come in and request a waypoint on behalf of the Spire. This waypoint, I'm hoping will be a Tier 2 waypoint with Healer's Boon growing prevalently throughout the area.

Waypoint Type: Region
Monster Theme: ???
Material: Healer's Boon
Tier: II
Jurisdicition: The Spire
Requester: Drallengrey
