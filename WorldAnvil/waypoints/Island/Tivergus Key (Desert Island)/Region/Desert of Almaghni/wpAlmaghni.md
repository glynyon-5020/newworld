!servalias wpAlmaghni embed -title "Waytravel to the Desert of Almaghni" -desc "The [Desert of Almaghni](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/new-world---dragonsmoke-archipelago-mortambo/a/desert-of-almaghni-location-1) is a contested region of endless sand dunes, broken only intermittently by mesas of bare stone. The monstrous purple worms infest the sands, drawn to any foolish enough to cross the waste, but they are only one threat among many. Water is scarce and precious. Thri kreen raiders disrupt what little trade does occur. Armies of Oread led by a powerful Efreeti and his sons trade blows with the Alseid legions following a family of noble Djinni, as they each strive for control of the nexus of untainted leylines which converge below this inhospitable land.

**Tier III Waypoint** | The Iron Coin will not allow anyone through of 10th level or lower. The monsters present flee instinctively should anyone of 17th level or higher arrive.

*See World Anvil Article for how to travel and what environmental hazards there are*
