# Waypoints

Throughout Dragonsmoke Archipelago there are a series of disconnected waypoints which the ancients used to easily travel about the realm without depending on the randomly wandering roads. Locating a waypoint establishes a specific site that the character can return to or guide other characters to which will have predictable (non-randomized) features. Once a waypoint is located, the reviewing DM describes those features, such as the environmental hazards, rare resources which might be found there, and common monsters which might live there.

Additionally, waypoints might be located at settlements which will then be available for other characters to travel to (establishing them as concrete within the lore) and possibly housing special vendors. 

There are a few different types of Waypoints.

## Islands

Need to figure out a good island size and island-to-region ratio. Or island to region-size ratio.

## Regions
  
If you aren't keen on grinding through a dungeon or dealing with people (NPCs), but find the idea of battling the environment in addition to deadly monsters, then regions are for you. These offer more special encounters (and in some cases, ones that can be slain more than once) than the other two waypoint types. Help us build a forest, cave complex, underdark region, desert, jungle, tundra, or whatever fits your fancy. 

Regions are the fundamental building block of our Waypoint System. Regions come in various sizes: tiny, small, medium, large, huge, and gargantuan (to follow the monster-size format).

Waystones only exist in a region. Any settlements, lairs, or dungeon waypoints within a region are a specified mileage away from the waystone and require travel to reach them.

### Tiny Regions

Tiny Regions have room for one additional waypoint location. A tiny region has a radius of 25 miles.

These will eventually have some kind of "renown" number associated to them for when guilds acquire and complete guild activities within the waypoint.

### Small Regions

Small regions have room for three additional waypoint locations. A small region has a radius of 50 miles.

### Medium Regions

Medium regions have room for five additional waypoint locations. A medium region has a radius of 100 miles.

### Large Regions

Large regions have room for seven additional waypoint locations. A large region has a radius of 200 miles.

### Huge Regions

Huge regions have room for nine additional waypoint locations. A huge region has a radius of 400 miles.

### Gargantuan Regions

Gargantuan regions have room for elevent additional waypoint locations. A gargantuan region has a radius of 800 miles.

## Dungeons

Dungeons are prebuilt dungeons, map included, with randomly numbered rooms that has a wandering encounter, room-assigned encounter, trap, hidden chest, boss, or descriptive text. These are large in size and are often composed of more than 10 encounters. Playing through a dungeon will earn you a spot on the "Dungeon Cleared" list for that dungeon in addition to access to a few treasure hoards, dependent on the difficulty of the dungeon and your tier of play.

These are not meant to be completed in one session. You may reach a checkpoint, end your session, and resume it at a later date. Ping a DM so they can help you lock in your checkpoint.   

Dungeons also have an associated WorldAnvil article that will include all of the dungeon details you need to be successful. The need to swap between browser and discord and to copy and paste makes this terrible to accomplish on mobile. You can also ping a DM to help navigate you through the dungeon.  

## Settlements

These are what they say. This is your opportunity to create specific buildings (inns, stables, castles, forts, races and the like) that become lore in the New World. Settlements often have wanted posters with significant rewards for unique monsters. They also offer quests, house player guilds, and contain special NPC vendors. If you get lucky, they may even be vendors that dabble in magical arts and thus have magical wares to sell!  

## Lairs

Lairs are epic DM-led battles that offer a treasure hoard *per player*. This is different from Special Encounters, as those have static rewards. Lairs are not meant to be attempted alone. The monsters have higher hit points, lair actions, and additional special effects that make these encounters especially dangerous, even for a group of adventurers.s
