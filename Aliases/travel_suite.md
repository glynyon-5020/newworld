# Aliases for Travel!

There are three aliases we use (for now) for traveling. We know they aren't the easiest to use. Note that they will be updated in the future to make it easier to manage in discord. Until then, know that we are all hobbyists and don't get paid for making these. :D We'll get to it when we can.

The aliases are:
- `!travel ## "Season Type"`
    - This alias shows how far you can travel per day and takes into account some weather factors you can use for roleplay 
- `!terrain "Terrain Type"`
    - This alias prints out the terrain features you encounter in your journeys. A lot of stuff can happen!
- `!progress ## ## ##`
    - This alias is useful for tracking your distance traveled and determine how much you may still travel today!

## !travel

The `!travel` alias takes in two parameters. One is required. 

The first parameter is a `number` equal to your base speed. For most characters, this would be `30`. You may also enter `spring` `summer` `fall` or `winter` after your speed. It would look like this:

`!travel 30 fall`

## !terrain

The `!terrain` alias is full of lots of goodies. This is required to find dungeon/settlement/lair waypoints. 

It takes in one parameter from the following list:
- arctic 
- coastal 
- desert
- forest
- jungle
- grassland
- hills 
- mountains 
- swamp

`!terrain forest`

## !progress

The `!progress` alias helps keep track of how far you can travel in a day, how far you just traveled, and how much farther you can travel. Helpful for bookkeeping purposes.

This takes in three parameters. All numbers. 

`!progress "current" "total" "past"`
`!progress 5 24 10`

I have just traveled 5 miles (current). I can travel a total of 24 miles a day (total), and I have traveled 15 miles (past) so far.
